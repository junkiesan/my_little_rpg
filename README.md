# Lua RPG â€“ LÃ–VE2D

This is a small 2D RPG prototype built with [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/) using the Lua programming language.  
You control a small red character, interact with NPCs, and complete a basic quest.  
Perfect for learning the basics of game development and Lua scripting.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- macOS (tested on Monterey/Ventura/Sonoma)
- [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org) installed

## ðŸ§° How to Install LÃ–VE2D on macOS

There are two main options:

### Option 1: Using Homebrew (recommended)

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you havenâ€™t already.
2. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   brew install --cask love
3. Once installed, you can run love from the command line.

### Option 2 â€“ Manual Installation

1. Go to the official website: https://love2d.org

2. Download the macOS version of LÃ–VE.

3. Move the LÃ–VE.app to your Applications folder.

To verify the installation, open Terminal and type:
`love`
You should see a blue screen with the LÃ–VE logo saying "No Game". This means it's working.

## How to Run the Game

1. Download or clone this project to your computer.

2. Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory. For example:
cd path/to/your/folder

3. Run the game by typing:
love .
(Don't forget the dot â€“ it tells LÃ–VE to run the current folder.)

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the project folder onto the LÃ–VE application icon.

## Notes

This game uses only the built-in LÃ–VE2D features â€“ no external libraries needed.

Tested with LÃ–VE 11.4 and macOS Sonoma.

If you want to export the game, you can zip the contents of the folder and rename the file extension to .love.
